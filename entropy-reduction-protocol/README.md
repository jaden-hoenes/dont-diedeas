# Entropy control protocol:

A long while ago I had a very specific dream of how systems worked most efficiently.
I thought about it a long time and named it Systems Theory, having never heard of Systems Theory before.

Last January I was able to put that all together with my friends Mike and Mike. We never did anything with
it, but we designed a set of rules a system of entities must follow to be deterministic and reproducible.
This was a way of structuring an Entity Control System we needed for our idea. 

Here are the set of rules we came up with:

Given a group of systems, their sibling systems, their parent "supersystem", and their child "subsystems"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
![drawing of systems, siblings, parents, and children](https://www.github.com/jaden-hoenes/dont-diedeas/tree/main/entropy-reduction-protocol/systems.png)

> 1. A system defines its' communication protocol
> 2. A system communicates to its' subsystem and the subsystem responds
> 3. A system cannot communicate with its' siblings
> 4. A system cannot initiate communication with its' supersystem

Since then I've thought through that problem over and over, letting it marinate. Just a few days ago I realized the reason that the rules can
guarantee a deterministic and reproducible result. It's because this structure ensures a system, paired with it's supersystem and subsystems, can guarantee order.
Once you apply this rule, I now believe that it is truly deterministic and reproducible.

> 5. A system responds to communications in the order they're received.

Now that you have this quality I think it is reasonable that if you base a societal protocol on these principles that allows you to effectively measure how various societies perform.
This could open the door for us to effectively experiment on society. For our entire history the ability to collect useful data has hindered a lot of research on society and how we should structure it. I hope that as humanity goes forward that we can continue to iterate on ourselves to make the world a better place.

Another limitation in the original design I found was that it was designed as an entity control system, rather than a system to govern protocols. An entity is an arbitrary delineation based on a collection of energy. A protocol describes how energy changes over time. Therefore entity-based will only be true for any given point in time, whereas protocol-based can change over time.

### If we were redesigning society, how would we do it?

Because we now can collect the data to effectively research society and we can begin a first iteration. I am calling my current guess an Entropy Reducing Protocol or Luna for short.

##### Luna

Luna is a governing protocol designed to give us the tools we need to standardize society in a way that gives individuals autonomy and properly aligns our incentives to improve our species and our planet.

It is characterized by 3 main values:
- Transparency
- Localized Responsibility
- Equity

Next we need a set of systems to consider, in a concentric ring pattern.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
![A concentric ring diagram of our systems](https://www.github.com/jaden-hoenes/dont-diedeas/tree/main/entropy-reduction-protocol/rings.png)

> 1. Individual
> 2. Household
> 3. Neighborhood
> 4. Village
> 5. Town
> 6. City
> 7. Region
> 8. Province
> 9. Planet

Outside the scope of Luna is a protocol to govern interplanetary systems. I know very little about space :(

The basis of the protocol is that all subsystems (recursive) must adhere to the rules for ordered systems for their communication
They also must follow a set of standard protocols

- Transparency protocol
```
Transparency protocol:
Knowledge contributed to Luna is free. Ideas are free.
A system must report statistics on the performance of each of its' protocols.
A system must disclose how each of its' required protocols are implemented.

* Note: This needs to be defined better. The idea is that all systems share their protocols to a decentralized source
        that anonymizes it, sanitizes it, publishes it, and anyone can query it. This is intended for the betterment of all systems.
```
- Localized Responsibility protocol
```
Localized Responsibility protocol:
A system is responsible for meeting it's own needs
If a system cannot meet its' own needs it must delegate them to it's supersystem. This is also recursive.

* Example: An Individual must implement a healthcare protocol. It cannot meet those needs so it delegates to its' supersystem,
           the Household. The Household cannot either, so it delegates up to the Neighborhood, then the Town, then the City. The City then
           decides if it is willing and able to meet that need. If it isn't, the implementation of the healthcare protocol is then delegated
           to the Region
```
- Equity protocol
```
Equity protocol:
Each sibling is granted fair say on how it's parent system implements its' protocols.
Each sibling is granted fair opportunity to contribute to the supersystem.
Each sibling is granted fair reward for its' contributions to the supersystem.

* Note: This is equity, not equality. I have no idea how this works in practice.
```
