# Radial Tariffs

Many of the problems with food quality, ecological degradation, political unrest, and any other number of pressing issues can be attributed to a lack of locality of responsibility.
This causes your dependencies to become less and less in your control.

To solve these types of issues I've been thinking locality of responsibility is a highly important principle.
An application of this idea to economics would be to base taxes and tariffs on locality of production.

By creating real incentive to buy local goods you connect the people to the means of production, and their livelihood.
I believe this helps solve the "NIMBY" problem. Maybe you don't want Draper prison moved to your backyard, but the acres of monoculture cash crops sprayed with pesticides multiple times a year probably isn't much better for you.
It also incentivizes business to be smaller only when practical. Because each tariff is systematically bounded it gives society the ability to find a good balance of tariffs for whatever product is at market.

If everyone buys their food from local farms the people working and owning those farms are much more likely to make sure they don't poison their own food supply.

It also helps reduce waste in the form of complexity. "Waste is a thief" and by increasing complexity for "efficiency" you often end up reducing the overall efficiency of the system.

An example would be food. Here is a generated answer from Claude (super low effort I know) on how someone is expected to get a chocolate bar in modern society.
Let me walk you through the journey of a chocolate bar, starting from the cacao tree to a store shelf in Salt Lake City. Feel free to skip it, it's mostly needless complexity.

```
The Journey Begins: Cacao Cultivation
- Most cacao trees are grown within 20° north or south of the equator, primarily in West Africa (Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire), Indonesia, and South America.
- Farmers plant cacao seedlings in the shade of taller trees like banana or plantain.
- It takes 3-5 years for a tree to produce its first pods.
- Trees require regular fertilization, pruning, and pest control by farm workers.
- Each tree produces about 20-30 pods per year.

Harvesting and Initial Processing:
- Workers carefully cut pods by hand using machetes.
- Pods are split open and beans with pulp are removed.
- Beans undergo fermentation for 5-7 days in banana-leaf covered piles.
- Workers turn the beans regularly during fermentation.
- Beans are dried in the sun for 5-7 days on raised platforms.

Transportation and Processing:
1. Dried beans are packed into burlap sacks and transported to local collection points
2. Beans are shipped to major ports via truck and boat
3. Ocean freight carries beans to US ports (likely Los Angeles for Utah-bound chocolate)
4. Beans are transported to chocolate manufacturing facilities (let's say in Chicago)
5. At the factory:
   - Beans are cleaned and roasted
   - Shells are removed (winnowing)
   - Nibs are ground into cocoa liquor
   - Additional processing separates cocoa butter and cocoa powder
   - Ingredients are mixed (cocoa liquor, cocoa butter, sugar, milk powder, etc.)
   - Mixture undergoes conching (heating and aerating)
   - Chocolate is tempered and molded into bars
   - Bars are packaged and boxed

Final Distribution:
- Boxed products are shipped to regional distribution centers
- Trucks transport boxes to local warehouses
- Final delivery to retail stores in Salt Lake City

Approximate People Involved (Direct Contact):
- Farm workers (planting, maintenance, harvesting): 8-10
- Fermentation and drying workers: 4-6
- Local transportation and port workers: 6-8
- Ocean freight crew: 15-20
- Chocolate factory workers: 20-25
- Distribution and logistics workers: 10-12
- Store staff: 2-3
Total: 65-84 people directly handling the product

Estimated Travel Distance to Salt Lake City:
(Assuming beans from Ghana, manufacturing in Chicago)
- Farm to African port: ~200 miles
- Ocean journey to Los Angeles: ~9,000 miles
- Los Angeles to Chicago: ~2,000 miles
- Chicago to Salt Lake City: ~1,500 miles
Total approximate distance: 12,700 miles

This doesn't include the auxiliary workers involved in:
- Making fertilizers and agricultural supplies
- Manufacturing packaging materials
- Producing other ingredients (sugar, milk powder, etc.)
- Maintaining vehicles and equipment
- Managing quality control and food safety
- Administrative and sales roles
- Engineers and maintenance staff at facilities

If we included all these indirect contributors, the total number of people involved in getting your chocolate bar to the store would likely exceed 200 individuals.

One way to put the proper incentives might be something akin to the following:

1. When a business wants to sell something (goods, services, etc) there is a tax assessed based on where the item of sale was created, and where it is sold.
2. Based on what is for sale the community / governing body decides a scaling distance that will be used to measure different radii corresponding to different levels of tax associated.
3. Things you create yourself are not taxed in any way until sold.
4. Inside the first radii (a local sale) the manufacturer pays a tax to the local government (first guess is 10%). This incentivizes the local government to support local business.
5. Inside all other radii an import tarrif is paid from the consumer to the local government of the place of manufacture.

There are a million questions to answer here... I have a picture I'll put in this repo to demonstrate. I'd like to do a couple "simulations" of what this might look like in practice.
